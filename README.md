Youtube Video Transcribe Summarizer LLM App With Google Gemini Pro
This project aims to create an end-to-end YouTube video transcription and summarization system using Google's Gemini API.
The system takes a YouTube video URL and automatically extracts the video transcript using the YouTube Transcript API.
The transcript is then summarized using Gemini API's "Generate Content" model, which provides a concise and informative summary within 250 words.
The summary is displayed as Markdown within a Streamlit app, along with the video's thumbnail image.
The app allows users to paste any YouTube video URL and get a detailed transcription and summary of the video's content.
